  summary: 'An implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical regression models. At the
    heart of it are the vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes,
    and the book "Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation
    in R" (Yee, 2015) <DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7> gives details of the statistical
    framework and VGAM package. Currently only fixed-effects models are implemented,
    i.e., no random-effects models. Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated
    by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE, using Fisher scoring. VGLMs
    can be loosely thought of as multivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs (i.e.,
    with smoothing). The other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic
    RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these classes
    perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology,
    as well as constrained additive ordination (CAO). Note that these functions are
    subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog files for latest changes.'
